   <h2>Enhancements</h2>
   <p class="enh">
    Enhancement 1: Use of Animation Property<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another</li>
      <li>When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times</li>
      <li>Applied the Animation Property for the heading present on the page <a href="index.html">Home Page</a></li>
      <li>The setting is applied in the style.css file for the content to move an element from 0px to 750 left. The animation lasts for 5 seconds. It then starts over again, and goes on forever (infinite).</li>
      <li>In order to complete this enhancement, it is advised to complete the activities on <a href="https://www.w3schools.in/html/">W3Schools</a> </li>
    </ul> <br>
<p class="enh">Enhancement 2: Use of Hover pseudo class</p>
<ul>
  <li>Applied the 'hover' selector on Navigation bar</li>
  <li>You can use :hover with various CSS properties to create hover effects for different types of elements like text, images, buttons, links, etc.</li>
  <li>To view this, hover your cursor on the navigation bar on any of the menus or hover on <span class="special">Contact Us</span> part in the footer section</li>
  <li>The color changes once you place/hover the pointer</li>
  <li>In order to complete this enhancement, it is advised to complete the activities on <a href="https://www.w3schools.in/html/">W3Schools Website</a> </li>
</ul><br>

<p class="enh">Enhancement 3: Implementation of Timer</p>
<ul>
  <li>To trigger the event, the user must login-in to the Quiz Questions webpage (quiz.html)</li>
  <li>When the DOMContentLoaded event occurs, signaling that the HTML content of the page has been fully loaded, the script will check if the current page's URL ends with <span class="special">quiz.html</span></li>
  <li>If it does, it imposes a 1-minute time limit. Then it begins a countdown timer, which decrements every second.</li>
  <li>When the time limit is passed (1 minute in this case), it shows a warning notice on the top of the webpage telling the user that the time has expired and redirects them to the login page. After a 9-second delay, it sends the user to the login page.</li>
  <li>To implement this feature, the programmer needs to:<br>
    Embed the provided JavaScript code within a script tag in the HTML document or link it externally.<br>
    Ensure that the filename of the webpage where this feature should be implemented is quiz.html<br>
    Make sure that the login page is named login.html and is located in the same directory as the quiz.html page<br>
  </li>

</ul>
